Uterine fibroids, as a kind of benign tumour commonly found in women of childbearing age, are not life-threatening in most cases, but the irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, frequent urination and other symptoms caused by fibroids have really brought troubles to the life of many women. Along with the continuous advancement of medical technology, the treatment of fibroids has also seen innovation and improvement, giving patients more and more personalised treatment options. Today, let's talk about the new and improved techniques in the treatment of uterine fibroids, in order to let you have a more comprehensive knowledge about this topic.

### Innovation of Surgical Techniques: Widespread Use of Minimally Invasive Surgery

When it comes to the treatment of uterine fibroids, surgery is often the first way that comes to the mind of many people. However, traditional open surgery is traumatic and slow in recovery, which makes many patients fearful. Fortunately, with the rapid development of minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted surgery, the treatment of uterine fibroids has undergone a sea change.　

Laparoscopic surgery: Through a tiny incision in the abdominal wall, the surgeon uses a laparoscope and its accompanying instruments to perform the surgery. This technique is not only less invasive and less bleeding, but also has a quick recovery and less pain, greatly shortening the patient's hospital stay and recovery period.

Robotic-assisted surgery: As an upgraded version of laparoscopic surgery, robotic-assisted surgery provides doctors with a more accurate and stable operating platform with the help of advanced robotic systems. Robotic-assisted surgery has demonstrated higher safety and effectiveness in the treatment of complicated or specially located uterine fibroids.
　
### The rise of non-surgical treatment: a new choice for uterus preservation

The development of non-surgical treatments has been a boon to patients who are either unfit or unwilling to undergo surgery. Under the premise of preserving the uterus, these innovative therapies can induce fibroid shrinkage or necrosis through different physical or chemical means, thus relieving patients' symptoms.

Focused Ultrasound Therapy: Using the focused effect of ultrasound waves, it precisely destroys the fibroid tissue, causing it to be gradually absorbed or expelled from the body. This method does not require incision, the treatment process is painless and does not damage the surrounding normal tissues.（I recommend）

Microwave therapy: Through the thermal effect of microwave, the fibroid tissue will undergo coagulative necrosis and then gradually be absorbed by the body. Microwave treatment also has the advantages of small trauma and quick recovery.

Radiofrequency ablation therapy: using the heat energy generated by radiofrequency current to destroy the growth environment of leiomyoma cells and make them gradually shrink. Radiofrequency ablation therapy is not only easy to operate, but also has a short treatment time and high patient comfort.

Uterine Artery Embolisation: Through interventional means, an embolic agent is injected into the uterine artery to block the blood supply of the fibroid and cause it to gradually necrose. This method is especially suitable for patients who wish to preserve the uterus and have large fibroids.

### Choose the most suitable treatment for yourself

When facing the treatment of fibroids, patients do not need to worry too much or choose blindly. After fully understanding the advantages and disadvantages of various treatment methods, you should have in-depth communication with your doctor and formulate the most suitable treatment plan according to your condition, age, fertility needs and other factors. Whether it is minimally invasive surgery or non-surgical treatment, modern medical technology provides more and more humane choices for uterine fibroids patients.
