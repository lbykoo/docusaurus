On the ‘battlefield’ of women's health, ovarian cancer is like a hidden ‘killer’, often wreaking havoc when people are unaware of it, and very often it is found at an advanced stage.

First of all, the ovary is located deep in the pelvis. It is like a ‘mysterious organ’ hiding in the dark, surrounded and protected by surrounding bones, muscles and other tissues. This special anatomical location makes early ovarian lesions difficult to detect straight away. Even if the tumour has begun to grow, no obvious signs of abnormality will appear on the surface of the body as it is well hidden, which sets up the first obstacle that is difficult to cross for the early detection of ovarian cancer.

Secondly, early symptoms of ovarian cancer are extremely confusing. It may simply show some symptoms similar to common gynaecological diseases or digestive problems, such as mild bloating, abdominal pain, or poor appetite and indigestion. These symptoms are so common that they can easily be overlooked or mistaken for other benign diseases. Many women may think that it is just a temporary discomfort or caused by diet, stress and other factors, thus missing the time for early diagnosis.

Furthermore, there are still some limitations in the current early screening methods for ovarian cancer. Although there are some examination means, such as ultrasonography and tumour marker test, the accuracy of these methods in early diagnosis is not very high. Ultrasonography may be interfered by factors such as intestinal gas, while tumour markers, such as CA - 125, may be elevated in some other benign diseases, leading to misdiagnosis.

In addition, the lack of public awareness of ovarian cancer is also an important reason. Many women lack understanding of the symptoms and dangers of ovarian cancer as well as the importance of early screening, and do not develop the habit of regular gynaecological examination. Even if they have some minor abnormal symptoms, they do not seek medical treatment in time or do not mention these symptoms to their doctors, making their condition deteriorate gradually without their knowledge.

The fact that ovarian cancer is at an advanced stage as soon as it is detected is the result of a combination of factors. However, it does not mean that we can do nothing about ovarian cancer. With the continuous advancement of medical technology, more and more researches are being conducted to improve the early diagnosis rate and treatment effect of ovarian cancer. At the same time, strengthening public health education, raising women's awareness and vigilance against ovarian cancer, and encouraging regular gynaecological check-ups will also help in the early detection of ovarian cancer, and strive for more treatment opportunities and better prognosis for patients.
