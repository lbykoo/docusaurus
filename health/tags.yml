  description: Ovarian cancer is a malignant tumour that occurs in the ovarian tissue and it can adversely affect a woman's fertility and quality of life. As the important reproductive organs of women, ovaries undertake the functions of producing eggs and secreting sex hormones. However, the ovaries are located deep in the pelvic cavity, which makes early lesions difficult to be detected directly, so by the time most patients develop obvious symptoms, the tumour has often spread to surrounding tissues or distant organs.
