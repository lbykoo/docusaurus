# Why Does My iPhone Screen Turn Black When I Flip It Over?

If your iPhone screen goes black when you flip it over, it could be due to the "Raise to Wake" or "Attention Aware" features. Here's what could be happening:

Raise to Wake: This feature turns off the screen when the phone is not in use, and flipping it over might signal that you're done interacting with it. You can disable this feature by going to:

Settings > Display & Brightness > Turn off Raise to Wake.
Attention Aware: If you have Face ID-enabled iPhones, the Attention Aware feature dims or turns off the screen when it senses you're not looking at the phone. To adjust this:

Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Turn off Attention Aware Features.
Try checking these settings to see if either is causing the issue!
